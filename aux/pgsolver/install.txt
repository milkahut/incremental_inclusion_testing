       QUICK INSTALLATION GUIDE FOR THE PGSOLVER COLLECTION
*********************************************************************

This guide explains how to quickly install and configure the PGSolver
Collection of Parity Game Solvers. We highly recommend to read the
documentation file (./doc/pgsolver.pdf) instead.



Obtaining PGSolver:

	You can obtain the source code of the PGSolver library from

	    http://www.tcs.ifi.lmu.de/pgsolver

	Download and unpack the archive.

	    ~> tar xzvf pgsolver.tgz

	Unpacking will create a directory ./pgsolver and various
	subdirectories in it.



Required Compilers:

	In order to compile PGSolver from source code you will need the
	OCaml compiler; we recommend version 3.09.2 or higher, but
	earlier versions may just as well be fine. You can get it from

	    http://caml.inria.fr

	You will also need GNU make; we recommend version 3.81 or higher
	but earlier ones may suffice as well.
    You can get it from

	    http://www.gnu.org/software/make



Configuring PGSolver:

	There is one config file,

		./Config.default

	that has to be edited. It is highly recommended to create a copy
	of the file with the name Config in the respective directory
	that is to be edited instead of the original version. The
	Makefile checks whether a customized configuration file named
	Config exists and if so it is used instead of the default
	versions.

	The configuration file starts with declarations about where to
	find all the programs necessary to build the executable MLSolver.

        OCAMLOPT=ocamlopt
        OCAMLLEX=ocamllex
        OCAMLYACC=ocamlyacc

	Change these lines to point to the full path in which the OCaml
	compiler, lexer and parser generator are installed unless they
	are in the current PATH.

	You need to give the full path of you OCaml installation
	directory.

	    OCAML_DIR=/usr/lib/ocaml



Compiling PGSolver:

	Once you have adjusted both Config files accordingly you can now
	compile PGSolver by simply calling the make program.

	    ~/pgsolver> make all

	After successful compilation, several executables can be found in
	the subdirectory bin.
